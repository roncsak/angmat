# angmat
Angular 2 / Material 2 playground
---
This project is created to play with angular2 (angular.io) and angular-material2.

## Installation
First, you need angular-cli globally installed:
```bash
npm install -g angular-cli
```
Secondly, install the project.
```bash
npm install
```
Run the project with:
```bash
ng serve
```
Note: On Windows, running the project may fail if Command Prompt is not started with
Administrative privilages.

Also, I use the file .typingsrc to set proxy settings in corporate environment.
If you don't need it, simply delete the file.
